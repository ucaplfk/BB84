The number of photons per pulse is calculated to be $\approx$ 0.6 when operating the diode laser as an approximate single photon source. The < 80 ps laser pulse width cannot be resolved due to the 0.21 ns trigger detection width which provides the ultimate resolution of pulse detection. Despite photon state detection enabling Alice and Bob to remove the bits which are not measured in the incorrect basis, the quantum bit error rate (QBER) for two of the prepared photon states is determined to be too large. The reasons these errors exceed the 15 $\%$ critical error rate which ensures secured transfer of information is therefore investigated.
